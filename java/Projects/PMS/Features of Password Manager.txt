STRONG SECURITY -
Ciphertext is encrypted text that is unreadable without the proper cipher to decrypt it.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, Rijndael) [Cypher 1] and the Twofish algorithm [Cypher 2] to encrypt its password databases.

A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts a variable number of characters into a fixed-length string. 
The string is called a hash value or hash. 

SHA-256, or Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit, is a cryptographic hash function that converts text into a 256-bit alphanumeric string.
The output is a hash value, which is a unique digital fingerprint of a piece of data.
The SHA-256 algorithm takes an input (message) and produces a fixed-size output (hash value).
The output is unique to each input and appears random, making it difficult to reverse-engineer the original message from the hash value. 
SHA-256's 256-bit hash value provides a larger search space compared to its predecessor, making it computationally infeasible to reverse engineer the original input from the hash value.

HashMap -
In Java, a dictionary is an abstract class that represents a key/value storage repository and operates much like Map. 
The Dictionary class is deprecated and no longer recommended for use. 
Instead, the HashMap class should be used, which is a concrete implementation of the Map interface.
A HashMap is a collection that implements the Map interface and stores data in (Key, Value) pairs. 
Here, keys are unique identifiers used to associate each value on a map. HashMap is unsynchronized, therefore it's faster and uses less memory than HashTable.
The main difference between a dictionary and a hashmap is that a dictionary uses a built-in hash table to store key-value pairs, while a hashmap uses a user-defined hash function to map keys to values.
